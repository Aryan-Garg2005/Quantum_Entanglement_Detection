# Quantum Entanglement Detection in Bipartite Qutrit Systems using Machine Learning

## Overview  
This project develops a machine-learning framework for detecting quantum entanglement in bipartite qutrit (3 × 3) systems. Unlike qubit-based systems, qutrit states exist in a higher-dimensional Hilbert space, which makes entanglement detection more complex and demanding in terms of computation.  

Using graph-generated quantum states, this project shows that supervised machine-learning models can accurately classify quantum states as entangled or separable. The classification accuracies reach as high as 96%.

## Results

**Gradient boosting** consistently performed better than other models, reaching classification accuracies of up to **96%** on held-out test data.
